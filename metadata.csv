Experiment,Usually a description of the main type of treatment applied to the experiment,,,,
location ,"Location of field (Rosemount located in UMORE park near Rosemount, MN; Staples)",,,,
ID,Plot number ,,,,
Trt_code,Code for which treatment of Nitrogen was used for each plot,,,,
Lodging_at_harvest,"Subjective assesment of each plots lodging on a scale of 0 to 10, 1=standing straight, 10=completely flat. Recorded at time of harvest.  Not recorded for 2018?",,,,
Height1-5,Measurement of 5 randomly selected IWG plants in cm when fully extended.  Recorded at time of harvest.  Not recorded for 2018?,,,,
Dry_seedheads(g),Weight of dried unthreshed seedheads.  Bag weight has been removed.,,,,
Threshed_grain_plot_yield(g),"Final weight (g) of grain after it was dried, threshed, cleaned. Value is grain only.  At Staples in 2018, seedheads were cut from 2 quadrates in each plot, each 18"" x 36"" positioned to include 3 IWG rows (each 36"" long). Stand is planted on 6"" rows.",,,,

Staples grain yield conversion,"1 ha is 107639 square feet. If square, that is 328 ft by 328 ft. In a 6"" row spacing, that is 656 rows, each 328 feet long (215168 linear feet). We sampled 6 each 36"" (3 ft) long, or 18 linear feet. Multiply sample by (215168/18) and then by 0.001 for kg /ha ",,,,
Rosemount grain yield conversion based on rows,"1 ha is 107639 square feet. If square, that is 328 ft by 328 ft (or 3936"" by 3936""). Average row spacing in R-100 is 20"" (alternating 16"" and 24"" rows), so there is 196 rows in a square ha. We sampled 2 rows, each 34"" totaling 68"". Mulitply sample by 196 * (3934/68)*0.001",,,,
Rosemount grain yield conversion based on area,"Sampled grain from a 42"" by 34"" quadrat, which is 1428 square inches. There are 0.00009212885 quadrats (1428 square inches each) per ha. Then multiply by 0.001 for g to kg",,,,

Staples grain yield conversion,"1 ha is 107639 square feet. If square, that is 328 ft by 328 ft (or 3936"" by 3936""). Samples from 24"" by 24"" quadrat: That's four rows, each 24"" long. There are 656 rows in a square ha. We sampled 4 rows, each 24"" totaling 96"". Mulitply sample by 656 * (3936/96)*0.001",,,,
Rosemount R100,"1 ha is 107639 square feet. If square, that is 328 ft by 328 ft (or 3936"" by 3936""). Average row spacing in R-100 is 20"" (alternating 16"" and 24"" rows), so there is 196 rows in a square ha. We sampled 2 rows, each 24"" totaling 48"". Mulitply sample by 196 * (3936/48)*0.001",,,,
Rosemount V17,"Sampled grain from a 24"" by 24"" quadrat. 1 ha is 107639 square feet. If square, that is 328 ft by 328 ft (or 3936"" by 3936""). Row spacing in V-17 is 16"", so there is 246 rows in a square ha. We sampled 2 rows, each 24"" totaling 48"". Mulitply sample by 246 * (3936/48)*0.001",,,,
