# n-rate-timing
nitrogen rate timing experiment

This contains a combind dataset and analysis from a suite of field trials where nitrogen was applied to wheatgrass stands at different rates and timings. 

nrate_draft.qmd is the file where drafting of key figures tables and text is being developed. 

The archive folder contains old R scripts when I was doing exploratory data analysis and writing spaghetti code. It got so confusing I just moved everything to the archive folder and started fresh with nrate_draft.qmd
